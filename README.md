## NuTyX

**ENGLISH** [NuTyX](http://www.nutyx.org) is a GNU/Linux distribution for multiple architectures inspired by the online 
documentation [Linux From Scratch (LFS)](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org).

NuTyX features a custom package manager called "cards". Cards can install binary packages, a set of related binary packages
(e.g. desktop packages, such as KDE or Xfce), and compile source packages from "ports". The distribution is designed
for intermediate and advanced Linux users.

Contributions are welcome. If you don't know what it all about, please take the time to read the documentation at
http://www.nutyx.org/en/build-package.html
(version fran√ßaise)
http://www.nutyx.org/fr/build-package.html

It will explain you what's a collection, a git, a port, the tools around 'cards' etc

Have fun :)

## NuTyX (Xposed)
**ENGLISH** Nutyx Xposed is a remake of the original Nutyx, but with a different version control, in such a way that the packages most essential for the system are constantly updated but not so fast as to be unstable, while the packages with less risk are Updated almost instantly, which makes Nutyx Xposed always up-to-date and stable.
