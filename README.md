## NuTyX Xposed

**NuTyX Xposed** is a community repository for NuTyX. It contains package descriptions files (Pkgfiles) that allow you to compile a package from source with [Caurds](https://github.com/wilssonmartee/caurds) and then install it. **Xposed** was created to help the community install popular packages that are not available in the official nutyx repositories. 

---

### Getting started

Advanced users can download the Pkgfiles and manage them manually, but we have a very useful tool that makes it easier for us called [**CAURDS.**](https://github.com/wilssonmartee/caurds)


### Caurds

Caurds is a cards helper designed and programmed to handle user-created package descriptions (Pkgfile).
